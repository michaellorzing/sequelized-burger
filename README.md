# Express-Burger

#Requirements

* Make an app that adds new burgers to a menu, allows the user to "devour" them, update new instances of the available burgers, and delete menu items

# Technologies Used

* Express
* MYSQL
* JavaScript
* Handlebars
* Node

# Brief Explanation

The app starts with a pre-seeded table in MYSQL that houses a list of burgers and if they are eaten or not. Via express, routes for the api are established and calls to the API are predetermined to work with the routes. The information is then appended dynamically to the page where the user can simply add burgers and click buttons to devour, remove, or update them.
